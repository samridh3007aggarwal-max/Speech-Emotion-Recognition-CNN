## 🚀 Future Improvements
1. **Data Augmentation:** Add noise, pitch shifting, and time-stretching to the audio to make the model more robust to different environments.
2. **Hybrid Architecture:** Combine the CNN with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to better capture the temporal (time-based) patterns in speech.
3. **Real-time Inference:** Implement a live microphone stream using `pyaudio` to predict emotions in real-time.
